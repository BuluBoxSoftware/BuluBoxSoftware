 Bulu uses the zebra printing tecnology to print GNC labels. All zebra printers use a Programming Language called (ZPL), which is a command based language used by the printers as instructions to create the images printed on the labels. 
 
 A unique URL is given to each printing machine:

- http://zebra4/dhl.php
- http://zebra5/dhl.php
- http://zebra6/dhl.php
- http://zebra7/dhl.php

Each URL contains a drop file folder where the labels will be dopped for printing. Each URL is assigned to each zebra printer.
