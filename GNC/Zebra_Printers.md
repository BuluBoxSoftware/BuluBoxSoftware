Bulu uses the zebra printing tecnology to print GNC labels. All zebra printers use a Programming Language called (ZPL), which is a command based language used by the printers as instructions to create the images printed on the labels [1]. Zebra pinters use thermal tecnology to print, thus there is no need to replenish the printer.
 
 
## Calebrate
 There are two main methods to calebrage the zebra printer:
 
 1. Calebrate the printers by simply turning the zebra printer power swicth OFF and then ON again. The swicth is loactaed in the back of eevrry prinetr. Once the printer is on it will automatally calibate.
 
## Configuration
1. Turn on the Zebra printer and connect the printer to your computer using the provided USB cord.<br>

2. Open Printers & Scanners on your Windows machine. The printer should be auto-detected within your Printers & Scanners. Rename the printer as desired. Set the Zebra printer as the default printer.
