<h1 align="center">PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)</h1>

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open-source, interpreted, and object-oriented scripting language that can be executed at the server-side. PHP is well suited for web development, therefore, it is used to develop web applications. PHP is known as a general-purpose scripting language that can be used to develop dynamic and interactive websites. It was among the first server-side languages that could be embedded into HTML, making it easier to add functionality to web pages without needing to call external files for data. PHP is mainly focused on server-side scripting, so you can do anything any other CGI program can do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies etc.
