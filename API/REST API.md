<h1 align="center"> REST API (Application Programming Interface)</h1>

**API**: An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It’s referred as a connection between an information provider and an information user—establishing the content required from the consumer (the call) and the content required by the producer (the response).

**REST**: REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. When a client request is made via a RESTful API, it transfers a representation of the state of the resource to the requester or endpoint. This information, or representation, is delivered in one of several formats via HTTP: JSON (Javascript Object Notation), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is the most generally popular file format to use because, despite its name, it’s language-agnostic, as well as readable by both humans and machines.
