<h1 align="center"> REST API (Application Programming Interface)</h1>

**API**: An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It’s referred as a connection between an information provider and an information user—establishing the content required from the consumer (the call) and the content required by the producer (the response). API's alllows users to do testing without touching the GUI (Graphical User Interface) or live database of a website. 

**REST**: REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. When a client request is made via a RESTful API, it transfers a representation of the state of the resource to the requester or endpoint. This information, or representation, is delivered in one of several formats via HTTP: JSON (Javascript Object Notation), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is the most generally popular file format to use because, despite its name, it’s language-agnostic, as well as readable by both humans and machines [1]. 

**Headers**: Are part of the API request and response as they represent the meta-data associated with the API request and response. Headers carry information for:  Request, Response, Body and Authorization.

**Parameters**:  Are the variable parts of a resource. They determine the type of action you want to take on the resource. Each parameter has a name, value type ad optional description. Whenever you want to build a REST API, you have to decide which parameters should be present in the API endpoint.

**Authorization**: Authorization are used to ensure that client requests access data securely. This can involve authenticating the sender of a request and confirming that they have permission to access or manipulate the relevant data. In some cases Base64 encoding schemes are used in authorization when there is a need to encode binary data that needs to be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with ASCII.

## Types of API

<ul>
  <li>Funtionality Testing</li>
  <li>Load Testing</li>
  <li>Security Testing</li>
  <li>Penetration Testing</li>
  <li>Navigate Testing</li>
</ul>  

## API Langaunges
API testing can be done in a number of programming lanuanges, the following are some few pratical languages used for API testing: 

<ul>
  <li>XML</li>
  <li>JSON</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>GraphQL</li>
</ul>
