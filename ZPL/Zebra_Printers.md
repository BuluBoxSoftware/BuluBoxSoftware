Bulu uses the zebra printing technology to print GNC labels. All zebra printers use a Programming Language called (ZPL), which is a command-based language used by the printers as instructions to create the images printed on the labels [1]. Zebra painters use thermal technology to print, thus there is no need to replenish the printer.
